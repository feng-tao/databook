# CSV file formats

The CSV files are generated by custom scripts that take the data from other sources, so they
populate the graph database with the relationships between your data and people.

### Users

Users may be extracted from active directory for example. The idea is that you get some
basic information about them, so that you can initialize the nodes for "Person". 

|column name|purpose|
|-----------|-------|
|login|Login name from active directory, useful as business key for employee and a unique identifier|
|email|Useful to add as an attribute for contact information|
|name|Obviously useful|
|role|Useful attribute to add to understand place in the organization|
|slack|Useful attribute for direct messaging|
|github|Reconciles with github user|
|location|Specifies the location where the user works and can be useful for planning meetings|

Obviously this means that reconciling users means connecting to multiple systems to enrich 
the person properties.
